Earlier we have seen the problem – Find the number of islands. 
In that problem, the objective was to find the total number of islands 
in the grid. 
Finding distinct islands can be considered an extension of that problem.
 We will use the same approach with some modifications.

Use Depth-First Search

If all the nodes in the grid are connected then after DFS all the nodes
 will be visited and there will be only one Island in the grid. If 
 there are more islands in the grid we need to multiple DFS to visit 
 them all. So Number of Islands will be equal to the number of DFS 
 required to visit all isLands (1’s)

How to determine if two islands are identical: If coordinates in two islands form an identical shape or structure. The coordinates of both the islands can be at a different location. See the example below
